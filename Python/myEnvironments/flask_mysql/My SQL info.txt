MySQL

If user deletes account, id number is not reused for new record.

(HTTP requests consist of a method - GET/POST etc - and a URL.)

3 rules of normalisation:

1. Each row must contain one value, eg. name = first_name and last_name.
2. Each column in table that is not a key must contain unique values, eg. movies with a separate genres table.
3. Cannot have a non-key column dependent on another non-key column, eg. for a books table, splitting publisher name and address into their own two separate tables, and linking all tables by a primary id.

Foreign keys put into the table that belongs to the “many” of the one-many relationship, eg. chapter has many sections, so the sections table has a chapter id foreign key.

Difference between dotted line and solid line on ERD diagram relationship is that solid line means relationship has to exist, dotted line can potentially exist.

Not every table in a database has to connect - eg. users do not have chapters, so don’t link tables.
